## My process

### Built with


- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is my first challenge using grid. The most difficult part was how to use different size like px,em, rem and how to chose the right height and width. I wasn't able to avoid
the use of vertical scrool bar and i don't know yet how to.
